This is the repository for the official website of [Forum Rh√¥ne-Alpes](http://www.forum-rhone-alpes.com).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get help get your own copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To get your development environment running, you need

```
Python 2.7, pip, mongodb
```

### Installing

To install the necessary python dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Before starting the application, launch a mongodb instance, and create a database named `heroku_lx65hjrq`.
Don't forget to set the environnement variable `MONDODB_URI` to the database uri.

```
export MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/heroku_lx65hjrq (most of the times)
```
To have access to the admin interface (allows viewing/editing db models), you may also want to set:

```
export ADMIN_ID=your_id && export ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_password
```

Finally, to get the project running, simply start the Flask server:

```
python ./runserver.py
```
